What I really liked about this website is the monochrome nature of the content. If felt gritty and really helped portray the message that the artists were expressing. 
I also like the transitions between screens where you had to initiate it yourself. 
The art style is very well done.  I typically play FPS games, but I have a special love for very pretty indie or small team platformers like Gris which is just gorgeous. 
This website reminds me of Gris a lot in the black and white semi grainy look to it.
