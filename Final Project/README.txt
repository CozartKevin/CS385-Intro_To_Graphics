Proposal:

    MVP: 
    Basic character controller (First person Shooter style)
    Multiple rotating shapes/objects (scattered around a room)
        -real idea is to have these objects to be on a pedistal in the Parthenon. or roman style building
            -Will be going for functionality over looks
    Ability to "Pick up" objects and use WASD to rotate these objects (Resident evil style)
    

    Additional Features: (if I have time) 
        have the ability to shoot something (Get physics involved for the LOLS)
            -Indiana jones/laura croft first person shooter vibes. 
        Add in music that changes depending on what object you pick up. 
            -dark an omonous/ light and fluffy / ambient music for general walking
        Turn into a small game where you just find objects in the level and observe them, maybe add in a puzzle to get to a back room that has a secret object.
